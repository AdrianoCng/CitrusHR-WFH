# CitrusHR-WFH

## Overview
**CitrusHR-WFH** is a Python script designed to simplify the process of booking work-from-home (WFH) days on the CitrusHR platform. If you find the native booking process on CitrusHR slow and cumbersome, this script can significantly speed up the workflow.

### Key Features
